    //By default the variable get stored in the stack memory.
    //Let suppose you have 4gb of RAM.
    //So the division of the memory take place like 8mb-16mb for stack and remaining for HEAP
    //If you have to make the arrray of 100000 size then it cannot be stored in the STACK.
    //What we will do that we will make pointer using new keyboard.
    //This new keyboard will activate the HEAP memory.
    //In the stack after the excution of the program/function/variable. 
    //Stack automatically realease the memory occupied by the program.
    //But in heap the memory could not delete by itself. 
    //We have to delete the memory using the DELETE Keyboard
